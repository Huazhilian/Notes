# Notes
Hey there! I'm currently learning Python, and I'll be updating the note files here regularly.

Just so you know, the folder's got Git, Markdown, Pypi, Python scripts and Python syntax notes in it at the moment. I'll add more if I have time, but don't worry, there'll always be everything you need in there!

Why not follow me as we learn Python together? I promise you'll find the notes super helpful, especially if you're just starting out.

Python is a great language to learn if you're just starting out.
